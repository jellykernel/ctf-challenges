# Jellykernel's CTF challenges

A repo containing my CTF challenges.

## Repo structure

You will find in each folder all my challenges sorted by category. For each category, there will be a README with the list of challenges and their description.

## Where are the write-ups ?

Write-ups can be found in the dedicated folder at the root of the repo. However, in the spirit of stimulating competition, write-ups for unsolved challenges will not be uploaded until someone finds a solution. 

## I solved one of such challenges ! How do I let you know ?

I invite you to submit your solution in a issue. If I validate it, then congratulations! You can now experience this very nice feeling of being the very *first* person to accomplish something no one else did before. To celebrate this, I will mention you in the write-up as the first solver :fire:
