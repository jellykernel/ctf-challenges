# Cryptography challenges

My second favorite category. The fact that I love math and especially algebra might explain this...

<summary>(Not So) Trusted Dealer</summary>

**Created for [GreHack '23](https://grehack.fr/2023) (11th edition)**

### Description

Alice and Bob want to compute something together, but they don't trust each other.
That's why they agreed to use a special system with a third party to still be able
to achieve it. Indeed, they are trusting you - the so-called Trusted Dealer - to
provide them some auxiliary data for this computation. And you are interested in
their secret inputs. Can you find them ?

The flag is formatted as `GH{alice_secret||bob_secret}` where Alice's and Bob's
secrets are in hexadecimal (`0x` prefix not included).
